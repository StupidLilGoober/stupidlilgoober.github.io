        A while back, I decided I was going to start making games.
        Why I did, I don't really know, but game engines (such as
        Godot and Unity) weren't much fun, so I decided to use
        <a href="https://sfml-dev.org">SFML</a>.
    </p>

        I don't really like long intros, so I guess I should just get
        on with what you're <em>really</em> here for.

        First, I decided it would be helpful to make a full list of
        things I would need to program, as that will give me a general
        idea of how I should program the solutions.

    <h1>Creating Snake</h1>
    <div>MONTH/DAY/YEAR</div>
    
    <p>
        A while back, I decided I was going to start making games.
        Why I did, I don't really know, but game engines (such as
        Godot and Unity) weren't much fun, so I decided to use
        <a href="https://sfml-dev.org">SFML</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        I don't really like long intros, so I guess I should just get
        on with what you're <em>really</em> here for.
    </p>
    <p>
        First, I decided it would be helpful to make a full list of
        things I would need to program, as that will give me a general
        idea of how I should program the solutions.
    </p>

        1. Window <br>
        2. Grid with integer values representing what's in it <br>
        3. Snake that can take up multiple spots <br>
        4. Basic controls <br>
        5. Fail state <br>
    </p>
    <sup>
        NOTE: I used C++ to program this, but the code examples will use Python to
        keep things readable.
    </sup>

        Obviously, I first created a window. But that's kind of boring,
        and I don't think you really care how I made the window, so first
        I will talk about creating the snake.

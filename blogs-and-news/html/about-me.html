<h1>About Me!</h1>
<p>10/4/2025</p>
<p>I am a Computer Scientist who enjoys creating games. I decided to
do Computer Science because I saw my friend making games, and I got
jealous of him and decided to start making my own on Scratch.</p>
<p>My games on scratch are, admittedly, really bad; but they are where
I got most of my skill from, so I guess I have to give them some credit.
I enjoy video games like Quake and Doom, both for their gameplay and
the technological marvels that went into making them.</p>
<p>I have a cactus (his name is Bob) and I talk to him when I am trying to
fix bugs. (Call me schizophrenic but it actually seems to work for some
reason).</p>
<p>I made a website because I wanted a more "formal" way of presenting my
work (although both me and you know this is not very formal).</p>
<h2>What I make</h2>
<p>I like creating cellular automata. Something about them, ever since I learned
about them last year from a game called 'sandboxels' enticed me, I have found
them interesting. I dunno, just the idea that a few simple rules can create
such complicated patterns made my tism "act-up". Now, I spend my days going to
school, going home, and making cool toys for me to play with.</p>
